To-Do List Project Overview

As a part of our learning and comprehension of Javascript objects, we were tasked with building a small to-do list web application using OOP. The criteria is as follows;

Must make use of Object Oriented Programming in the information used on the flashcards.

CSS must demonstrate a minimal level of competency, it cannot be left as black and white.

Plus - while the added functionality of the user typing into the flashcards the information is nice but not a must. Javascript constructor functions must be utilized in this project even if itâ€™s minimal.

No Jquery allowed.# TKH_Week6
